		<p>Hello fellow learners. We are embarking on a journey,
			at the end of which you would, hopefully, come out with the unique
			ability to play the GUITARRRRRRRR! I am not one for cheesy lines,
			 but one always rings true:- “It is very important to enjoy the journey
			 . The journey is the destination all along”. We promise to make this journey enjoyable.
			  To begin with, here are some of the common tips and questions,
				 asked and answered in order to make this fun (and followable, duh) :)</p>

		<b>How does one read the chord boxes?: <br></b>
This web-app gives instructions based on chord boxes. They are really easy to read, check out this image
	</p>

	<p>
		It is also helpful to know the name of the various strings
	</p>

		<p>
			How quickly will I be able to play songs?: <br>
Depends. Generally longer for people who are older, but still...depends.
		</p>
		<p>How often do I need to practice?: <br>
It is advisable to practice 15 minutes a day, 5 times a week. This is the optimum time as it ensures maximum practice while simultaneously ensuring that you don’t burn out.
</p>
	<p>
		My fingers hurt, my hands are not quick enough, should i take a break?: <br>
Yes, take a break. Let the muscles or the skin cells thicken. But do not give up.
	</p>
	<p>
		What type of guitars exist in this universe we call our reality. Which one should I get?: <br>
The basic types are <br>
i) Electric (including hollow bodied or semi-acoustics) <br>
ii) Acoustic (steel strings - including those with electrics fitted, so called electro acoustics) <br>
iii) Classical (nylon strings). <br>
	</p>
	<p>
		I am of the opinion for a beginner an electric guitar is the best option, mainly because they are a little easier to play and hence encouraging in terms of results. <br>
Here is a stream of consciousness: <br>
• Wanna play rock: buy an electric. <br>
• Wanna play classical: buy a nylon string classical guitar. <br>
• Wanna play folk: buy a steel string acoustic. <br>
• Aren’t really sure, get an electric. <br>
	</p>
	<p>
		What all do i need to get started?: <br>
A guitar (look at the previous question) <br>
This website <br>
Determination and willpower <br>
Pick (non essential) <br>
Tuner (app-store/play-store+your smartphone should be enough) <br>

	<p>
		Here are some tips that will help you make the best possible use of the time you so graciously give for practice: <br>
1. Practice what you can't do, not what you can. <br>
2. Never practice a mistake. Strive to get it right. <br>
3. Start slow and perfect it before you speed up. <br>
4. Using a timer actually saves time. <br>
5. Pay attention to one element at a time. <br>
 6. Practice a little every day, rather than giving your everything on a single day <br>
7. Track your practice: use a schedule. <br>
8. Don’t be harsh on yourself, if it sounds good, it is good! <br>
9. Playing and Practicing are very different, keep that in mind. <br>
10. Strive to become instinctive. <br>
